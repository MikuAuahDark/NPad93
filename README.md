NPad Libraries
=====

Various NPad Lua libraries for LOVE can be found here. Most libs are single files unless noted.

Check each file/folder for license terms.

NVec
-----

**N**Pad **Vec**tor library, LuaJIT FFI-accelerated [hump.vector](https://github.com/vrld/hump/blob/master/vector.lua)-compatible
vector library. Meant as drop-in replacement of hump.vector. Originally written for my game for optimization
purpose, but I think it's better if I make this as standalone and let everyone use it.

For documentation, check out hump.vector documentation: https://hump.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vector.html

NGrading
-----

**N**Pad Color **Grading**, provides easy color grading for your post-processing needs.

For documentation, check out the `ngrading` folder.

NWFC
-----

**N**Pad [**W**ave **F**unction **C**ollapse](https://github.com/mxgmn/WaveFunctionCollapse), WFC implemented in Lua and tries to
be 1:1 mapping between the original WFC.

NFML
-----

**N**Pad **F**FI/Fast/Fine **M**ath **L**ibrary, meant as alternative to CPML. **Work in progress!**

Functions mostly follows [GLSL function names](http://www.shaderific.com/glsl-functions).
